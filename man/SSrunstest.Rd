\usage{
SSrunstest(
  ss3rep = ss3diags::simple,
  mixing = "less",
  quants = c("cpue", "len", "age", "con")[1],
  indexselect = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ss3rep}{Stock Synthesis output as read by r4SS function SS_output}

\item{mixing}{\code{c("less","greater","two.sided")}. Default less is checking for
positive autocorrelation only}

\item{quants}{optional use of \code{c("cpue","len","age","con")}, default uses
CPUE.}

\item{indexselect}{Vector of fleet numbers for each model for which to
compare}

\item{verbose}{Report progress to R GUI?}
}
\value{
a dataframe with runs test p-value, if the test has passed or failed,
3x sigma high and low limits, and the type of data used. Rows are for each
fleet. Note, runs test passed if p-value > 0.05 (residuals are random) and
failed if p-value < 0.5 (residuals are not random)
}
\description{
Function for residual diagnostics. Outputs a runs test table that gives runs
test p-values, if the runs test passed (p-value > 0.05, residuals are random)
or failed (p-value < 0.05, residuals are not random), the 3x sigma limits for
indices or mean age or length and the type of input data (cpue, length comp,
age comp, size comp, or conditional age-at-length).
