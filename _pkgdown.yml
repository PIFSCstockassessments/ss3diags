     A simple, cod-like SS model was simulated using ss3sim. The model includes 
     2 fleets, one fishery and one survey. Catch data is available from year 26 
     to year 100 (final year of model). An index of abundance is available from 
     the survey fleet for years 62 - 100. No discard data was simulated. 
     Simulated composition data includes length (fleets 1 and 2), age (fleets 1 
     and 2), and conditional age-at-length (fleet 1).
